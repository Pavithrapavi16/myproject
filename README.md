To implements a library to perform 16 bit floating point arithmatic we need to run "arithmatic" file and "fir filter" file to  filter a signal generated by mixing sinusoids of three different frequencies. the filtered signal is then analyzed using FFT to obtain its magnitude spectrum, and the magnitude spectrum is saved to a file.
the library for 16 bit floating point arithmatic defines a class called 'FloatingPoint16' that implements the necessary arithmatic operations(+,-,*,/) and conversion operators(to/from 'float') for 16 bit floating point numbers.
the exponent bias is set to 15, and the format is defined as having 1 bit for sign, 5 bits for exponent, and 10 bits for fraction.
The main program first generates a signal by mixing sinusoids of frequencies f1, f2, and f3 and saves it to a file. It then designs an FIR filter to filter out frequency f3 and applies the filter to the signal using both 32-bit and 16-bit floating-point arithmetic. The filtered signals are saved to separate files. The FFT is then computed for both filtered signals, and their magnitude spectra are saved to separate files.
The magnitude spectra of the filtered signals are plotted using a software package such as MATLAB or Python. The plots show the difference between the magnitude spectra obtained using 32-bit and 16-bit floating-point arithmetic. The comparison of the FFT plots indicates the accuracy of the 16-bit floating-point arithmetic library. If the difference between the magnitude spectra is minimal, it can be concluded that the 16-bit floating-point arithmetic library has sufficient accuracy to perform the filtering operation.
